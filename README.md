# AI_Paper_Extraction

Multimodal pipeline for extracting structured, provenance-linked scientific
knowledge (synthesis conditions, characterization data, reaction outcomes)
from chemistry/materials literature — text, figures, and tables.

## Status

Early build, in progress. Working through the pipeline one stage at a time:

1. **PDF ingestion** (in progress) — parse text blocks and figures out of raw
   PDFs.
2. Section/layout parsing
3. Figure understanding (classification, structure recognition)
4. Table extraction
5. Schema-driven LLM extraction
6. Entity normalization (canonical IDs)
7. Provenance-linked knowledge graph

## Stage 1: PDF ingestion

`ingest/pdf_ingest.py` extracts, per page:
- Text blocks (position + content)
- Figures

The nontrivial part: journal figures (chemical structures, plots) are almost
always drawn as vector graphics — hundreds of individual path/line/fill
operations — not embedded raster images. Naively pulling embedded images
misses them entirely. The script instead clusters nearby vector-drawing
bounding boxes on each page into figure-sized regions, then rasterizes each
region to PNG.

Test paper: Rowsell et al., "The iron-catalysed Suzuki coupling of aryl
chlorides," *Nature Catalysis* 7, 1186-1198 (2024) — chosen for its reaction
scheme, large substrate-scope figures, and mechanistic plots.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ingest/pdf_ingest.py data/papers/suzuki_iron_2024
```

Outputs `raw_extraction.json` (per-page text blocks + figure metadata) and an
`images/` directory of rasterized figures, inside the paper's data directory.
